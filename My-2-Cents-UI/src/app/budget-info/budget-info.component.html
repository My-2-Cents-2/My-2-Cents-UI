        <p>This budget calculator is based on the 50 - 30 - 20 rule of thumb.</p>
        <p>Essentially, this rule breaks down your income into percentages that represent categories.</p>
        <p>Your Needs are equal to 50% percent of your total income.</p>
        <p>Needs qualify as things you cannot live without like: groceries, mortgage, insurance.</p>
        <p>Your Wants are equal to 30 percent of your income and would be eating out,
        hobbies, vacation, or shopping.</p>
        <p>Finally, Savings is equal to 20 percent of your income and represent items such as your</p>
        <p>401K, mutual funds, index funds, or other related holdings.</p>
